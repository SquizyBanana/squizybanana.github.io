<p>Tinkering: precent participle of tinker, &quot;to make small changes to something, especially in an attempt to repair or improve it.&quot; (<a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/tinkering" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cambridge Dictionairy</a>)</p>
<p>Trial and error: &quot;a way of achieving an aim or solving a problem by trying a number of different methods and learning from the mistakes that you make.&quot;(<a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/trial-and-error?q=Trial-and-error" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cambridge Dictionairy</a>)</p>
<p>Brainstorming: &quot;an activity or business method in which a group of people meet to suggest a lot of new ideas for possible development.&quot; (<a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/brainstorming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cambridge Dictionairy</a>)</p>
<p>From these defenitions, I would argue that the main difference between the three lies in the distance they go. Brainstorming goes the least far, keeping it solely at ideas. While trial and error goes to create something, it has the implication that once the problem is solved, you&#x27;re done. Tinkering is a state of constant improvement. You might have solved the problem that you originally had, but so much more could be done still. However, this definition is not exactly the same as the one given by the course. The defenition given by the course is quite explicit in the physical nature of tinkering, but the Cambridge dictionairy defenition doesn&#x27;t even imply a physical element. The &quot;something&quot; might also be something completely digital, a drawing, or text.</p>
<p>I will not be using generative AI unless you provide me with a fully ethically trained AI, proffesionals have standards!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you take a typical I-Tech related project case, list and explain 5 technical hurdles? To which extent do they allow for a &#x27;playful&#x27; approach in tackling them? Please give arguments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#x27;ll take a project I&#x27;m working on myself for this. The goal is to create wings that can be worn like a backpack and can be moved individually. The first hurdle i had to tacke was the general kinematics of the wings. I didn&#x27;t want the wings to only rotate around the shoulders, nor include an actuator at every joint. Idealy I would have only two actuators, one for each wing. So I went to my trusty box of legos and built a combination of links and kept moving around the joins ever so slightly untill the wing made the movements I wanted it to make.</p>
<p>Next came the part of actually moving the wings. For this there are a few issues. First off, with the way I had designed the wings, I needed vertical linear motion to make the wings move. I needed a material to make the wings out off that wouldn&#x27;t be too heavy. I needed something powerfull enough to move the wings. And I needed to connect everything structurally. Finally, it also had to stay reasonably affordable.</p>
<p>The main idea for the movement was to use a lead screw that I had left over from our M8 project. I&#x27;d cut the 90 CM of screw into two 40CM long sections and connect each to a wing. However, when I connected the whole screw with the motor that I wanted to use, it moved much too fast. This made me realize that I probably needed a gearbox. These were very expensive however. At this point, I could have gone back to the drawing board (I should have) but I got a little too stuck on the whole direct gearbox idea. Had I gone back to the legos to figure out a way to create this actuation I would&#x27;ve realised that I could have just used a worm gear to both reduce the speed as well as create a built in &quot;locking&quot; mechanism. Instead, the project laid abandoned untill I was talking to Edwin one day and he reccomended me this solution. Then, trying to implement this, I once again had an issue, this time with how to best support the lead screw. Where I once again got stuck in the solution I had envisioned. I do think that the biggest mistake I made with all of this is that after having figured out the kinematics I made everything in CAD. Had I stuck to more phisical experimentation I would have found my current solution, which is also a lot simpler, a lot faster. The current plan is to simply use ropes and a locking mechanism like those that can be found in &#x27;Jaloezieën&#x27; to pull the wings up, instead of pushing them using a motor. For the other two points (structural connections and materials) there is no real way of knowing it will work untill I try it. I&#x27;ll want to go for the lightest setup that still structurally works, which will most likely require a few itterations at least. Especially on how to lock the joints in the wing itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where would you go hunting for tinkerspiration? List 5 physical and 5 online resources valuable for an I-Tech specialist. In which did you already find inspiration for a project you did or that got on your bucket list?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the physical inspiration, I mainly use my collections of legos and electronics. However, these are much more focused on making mechanical stuff. For desiging the appearance of things I see quite a value in randomly shaped objects. They might not give a proper guide for how to define the shape of your creation, but they provide a good starting point. A rechtangular box for example could be used to lay out buttons for a machine. A maker space is a very good place for inspiration, not only because you have the tools to immediately get started, but also the general atmosphere there allows you to not reject ideas before you even tried them as quickly, at least im my experiance. Finaly, and this is somehting that works for basically everything, is a place that specifically has nothing to do with what you&#x27;re working on. This kinda ties back into what I was talking about in the last question, but if you&#x27;re always working in the same space, you could get stuck on a single idea that might not even work. Changing your surroundings for a bit might just allow your mind to wander enough to come up with new approaches.</p>
<p>As for digital inspiration, I get most from the youtube channel of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Nerdforge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NerdForge</a>. They make a lot of cool things, most of which are more visually focused rather then mechanical. Further more, art and games have both also acted as inspiration for things I worked on. Games are an especially good point of inspiration when designing Spaceships, which I do for worldbuilding. When it comes to the more mechanical stuff, a good place to start are either tutorials on how the components you have or general discussion forms about the thing you want to use/make. These are very good sources of information And knowing what is possible is about half the equation of figuring out what you will do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>List 5 domains, challenges or settings in which you would like to apply tinkering, and explain why. Can you identify some sweet spots, (perhaps beyond the well-known such as STEM education) and can you also define some limitations? Are there &#x27;untinkerable&#x27; domains?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first thing that comes to mind when applying tinkering to something outside STEM is shot composition in photography. You&#x27;re very deliberately placing objects and/or people and/or locations in your image in such a way that you create the nicest image possible. You could defenetly move quite a few things within this. Not only the objects, but also the place of people and the camera are very dinamic and can easily be changed. The only things that are hard to move would be landscapes and buildings. In a similar way, you can play with the appearance of any visual design. Though they might have their own limitations. Cooking would also defenetly be something where I can see tinkering eventually being beneficial. Right now my cooking is mostly limited to just recipies, but once you get a better understanding of what makes stuff taste good, you would not be as reliant on recipies and could also cook something nice if you only had some leftover ingredients in house. I&#x27;m a little hard pressed on which fields I would want to start using tinkering, but I do already use it (in my opinion) quite a bit when desigining electrical and mechanical systems for projects. I would like to keep doing so.</p>
<p>I would really appreciate it if doctors <em>wouldn&#x27;t</em> tinker with their patients, I think its better if medical research is left to the lab.</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/docs/TinkeringMaterials"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Tinkering Materials</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/docs/Reflection questions/Week_2"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Week 2</div></a></nav></div></div></div></div></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Docs</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/AboutMe">Portfolio</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">My works</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CoblaTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Youtube<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://trackmania.exchange/usershow/137071" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Trackmania Exchange<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Socials</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://discord.gg/89HXEWar8M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Discord</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="mailto:srozendom@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Email<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2025 Suzanne Rozendom.
