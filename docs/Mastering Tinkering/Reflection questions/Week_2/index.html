questions were, so I took the &quot;In between the sessions&quot; points and tried to answer them as best as possible here.</p>
<header><h1>Reflective Questions</h1></header>
<blockquote>
<p>Sit down after the session and review your notes and share materials and insights. If still fresh, work out some of the notes you took into a bit more detail if necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>describe the materials quickly experienced in the first session. What makes them suitable?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The materials we used during the sesson were the BYOR kit, the arduino grove sensor kit and the makedo carboard screws. Of the three, I only saw value in the first as the other two were just already existing things with extra limitations placed upon them. The BYOR was nice as you didn&#x27;t need any real preknowledge to start using the components, and there was also clearly some thought put into its interfacability with the holes through the PCBs and the provided splitpins. The grove kit was just an arduino starter kit but with different connectors. This meant that these parts could not (easily) be combined with other arduino projects. Furthermore, the parts were all connected in such a way that they already worked in their frame, but the manual (which was hidden behind a QR code) told us to remove them from the frame. Even if we weren&#x27;t supposed to put the things back into the box the way we found them, this would still be bad becaouse it would feel like breaking the components. The makedo cardboard screws were just splitpins that needed more support and could not turn when used. There is 0 reason I would use these over splitpins. Overall I think that the most important elements of the materials for them to be good tinkering materials were that they were (relatively) easy to use given a persons preknowledge of them, as well as that they should be mouldable to do the things you want them to do, or at least an approximation of them. If this is not directly possible through the material itself then at least it should be able to be interfaced with a material that can make up for what it is lacking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now also take a moment to consider your own thinking during the session. You may like or dislike the concept of mindset but it is a valuable concept to reflect on how your mind is tackling things (or how it is geared up to do a task). Do you recognise aspects of thinking that could be helpful or not helpful for tinkering? Quickly sum up your thoughts and findings and discuss them with the others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Generally with the three materials I first tried to figure out what the intended use was of the parts. With the BYOR this was easy, with the screws this was obvious, with the grove kit it was not very clear. Once I had a bit of a grasp on that I tried to figure out how to use them. Be it through the manual or just experimenting. This worked well for both the BYOR and screws, but not for the sensor kit. The issue with the sensor kit was that it did not have a clear intended use, as there were only really inputs. The only output that seemed to do anything was the little screen that just showed the measured data. The next step happened when I stumbled upon a limitation. To see if there was a way around it. One of the things that weirded me out at first was that the stepper in the BYOR kit could only turn in one way. But after some playing with the part I noticed the reverse switch. Similarly, when working with the screws I figured out that if you make a small cut from the hole of the screw outwards you could have the screw turn in one direction while staying stuck. These attempts at getting around limitations can be rather helpfull, especially in systems that seem rather limiting at first.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>which of the experienced tools and materials has the lowest threshold? i.e which materials are easiest to get started with (are grabbed right away, no thinking, no consideration)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of the three the cardboard and screws were the easiest to get started with, but at the same time if you are only using the screws for attachments then it is also the material where you run into limitations the quickest. However these can mostly if not completely be overcome by also incorporating split pins and (hot) glue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>which of the experienced tools and materials has the highest ceiling? I.e, with which materials could you come closest to applications in the real world?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The arduino grove sensor kit, while being quite confusing to get started with in 15 minutes, had a nice selection of sensor break out boards that, when the connectors are replaced, could easily be used in MVP prototypes or even fully developed products.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To which extent does the exact instruction play a role? Do you need an introduction in the materials(seed) or towards the goal (discovery) or the tooling/skills?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That depends a lot on the fidelity level of the material. The more complex the material, the more instruction or information is needed to get started. However, there should not be much instruction towards the goal if you want to have a free &quot;mindspace&quot;. If a lot of instruction is provided on the goal you get stuck in the penguin paradox as explained in the first lecture where you will be very focused on what was instructed and thus it is a lot harder to come up with new ideas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you recognise most of the aspects of the framework in action?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is trial and error in both discovering how the materials work as well as making small projects with them. Sometimes succesfull as was the case with BYOR, sometimes unsuccesfull as was the case with the grove kit. The seed of the two kits were the electronics, something unknown that was supposed to have some functionality that you wanted to discover. For the BYOR kit, a quick glance at the manual was enough to figure out how to power it, and after that our preknowledge of electronics was enough. For the grove kit, a lot more knowledge was required. This was provided through a digital manual. For this kit more general arduino tutorials would have probably also helped. It is a bit hard to say what we learned exactly throughout the tinkering process, as most of the tools we used we either already knew, or were lower level versions of things we knew. But especially when playing around with the BYOR kit, we eventually managed to chain all components back to back from the turn nob all the way to the stepper.</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/docs/Mastering Tinkering/Reflection questions/Week_1"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Session 1</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/docs/Mastering Tinkering/Reflection questions/Week_3"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Session 3</div></a></nav></div></div></div></div></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Docs</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/AboutMe">Portfolio</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">My works</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CoblaTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Youtube<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://trackmania.exchange/usershow/137071" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Trackmania Exchange<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Socials</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://discord.gg/89HXEWar8M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Discord</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="mailto:srozendom@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Email<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2025 Suzanne Rozendom.
