<p>My workspace is somewhat split into three parts depending on what I am doing. These places are in my room, in the garage and at my desk.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-room">My Room<a href="#my-room" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to My Room" title="Direct link to My Room">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>Wow, you get to see a girls room ;) The desk is a little mess I apologize. I hope the numbers are a little visible.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="My lovely room" src="/assets/images/Room-68409f9528c0d028e9f3f2b520ac8f29.jpg" width="4000" height="1800" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>I mostly use my room for early concept generation and figuring out how to make stuff work mechanically. But its also the place where I keep my stuff when I&#x27;m not working on it. The following things of note can be found in my room</p>
<ol>
<li>Lego, Lots of lego. Not only the built spaceship on my desk and the boxes under my bed but also about two full boxes of built sets are on display in my room. And of this, by far the largest part is Lego Technic.</li>
<li>My 3D printer. It isn&#x27;t all that special, just an ender 3 v2 with a direct feed mod so I can print TPU. I needed that to print molds for epoxy resin.</li>
<li>Electronics, Lots of electronics. I had a tendancy to hoard the electronics of our CreaTe projects so by now I have enough sensors to start a small electronics library.</li>
<li>RC car parts. Lots of parts. I thought it would be fun to upgrade my car so it would go a little faster, but then drove it into a tree at ~60 km/h. It did not survive that. And with the ammount of parts that broke from that, I was beter of getting a completely new car and transfering the upgrades. So now I have 80% of an extra RC car in spares.</li>
<li>Combat robot. Currently still in its box cuz I moved recently and couldn&#x27;t be bothered to reassemble it yet. For those curios what it is though, its an <a href="https://justcuzrobotics.com/products/ssp-robot-kit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SSP kit</a> ajusted for European regulations.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-garage">The garage<a href="#the-garage" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The garage" title="Direct link to The garage">â€‹</a></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="The garage" src="/assets/images/Shed-16d96b218e99b2567fb02bf04e38c3b3.jpg" width="4032" height="1816" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The garage is where I work on the more &quot;rough&quot; stuff. However, in reality its my dads space, so I can&#x27;t really keep any of my stuff here.</p>
<ol>
<li>Toolboxes. This one is my dads, but I also have my own. Together we have quite a lot of handtools from screwdrivers and hamers up to multimeters and line setters.</li>
<li>Storage. Back here is where the big tools and small materials are kept. Think of saws, drills, angle grinder, sanding machine as well as things like screws, nails, tire repair kits, break cleaner, loctite, etc.</li>
<li>Wood storage. Most of it is just outside the image but my dad has quite a bit of leftover wood from his own projects.</li>
<li>Table saw. For cutting big pieces of wood. The table can also be fliped to have a proper table saw setup.</li>
<li>Old drill that currently doesn&#x27;t work, and as far as I know my dad got it broken but just never fixed it.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-desk">My desk<a href="#my-desk" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to My desk" title="Direct link to My desk">â€‹</a></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="My desk" src="/assets/images/Desk-d1f0d2d945e61ae0e2bf1e595fb9d560.jpg" width="4032" height="1816" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>There is not much special about the desk to be honnest. Other then the fact that its in the kitchen instead of my own room as the wifi in my own room is super unstable. Cicled in blue to the left is a drawing tablet, which I use for sketches and drawings. This is also the place that I generally take my electronics from my room to assemble them and code them, but I&#x27;m not allowed to leave them here. (The current conditions are already bordeline too messy even though half the mess isn&#x27;t mine). The dissadvantages of having to live with your parents I guess... Anyways, generally I also make a CAD of whatever I&#x27;m making, especially when parts have to be printed. That also happens here.</p>
<p>While all of these spaces are nice on their own, they do kinda present an issue for me. I&#x27;m not very tempted to go out of my general space at my desk to go tinker on stuff. One could argue that making maps in Trackmania could qualify as tinkering, because while you&#x27;re trying a lot of things, you do them based on your knowledge of the car and the games physics, as well as why the last thing you tried didn&#x27;t work. However, the most &quot;hands on&quot; this gets is testing the map, where you&#x27;re still just pressing buttons. The main time I am motivated enough to actually get off my lazy ass and go make stuff is generally when I&#x27;m making something for someone else. But this only happens maybe once every three months. So for me probably the first thing I would want to expand my tinkering space is a way for all three spaces, or at least everything in my room and at my desk, to be integrated together. That way I will be much more tempted to actually start tinkering with stuff again.</p>
<h1>Design assinment</h1>
<p>For the design assinment I designed a combination of blocks and connectors that can be rotated together. While I love legos, it isn&#x27;t capable of holding up against pulling forces.
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="My desk" src="/assets/images/ModularBlocks-444fe912e5e378f608a6ce74b1474667.png" width="1920" height="2000" class="img_ev3q">
The idea started of with a single cube with three integrated connectors, but I soon realised this was probably not the nicest way of doing this so I turned the connector into a seperate part. The idea behind the connector is that a square piece nicely fits through the hole when rotated at 45 degrees, but when its rotated back its locked in place because the corners hook behind the back side of the hole. Later on I also made blocks with a slit instead of a hole and a round connector to allow for joints. This then also expanded into a block acting as a joint. Furthermore I throught up some support bars that can be &quot;screwed&quot; onto the side of the blocks, but I didn&#x27;t really like their appearance. But this did get me thinking about what would happen if you were to try and create a bigger block out of these blocks. It made me realize that with the base setup you couldn&#x27;t combine 4 in a 2x2 setup because you couldn&#x27;t rotate the blocks anymore. The solution i came up with is a slit in the connectors and holes through the bloks so the connectors can be &quot;screwed&quot; in after combining the blocks. I also came up with some more compex shapes, as well as some decorative pieces. With their shape and especially the decorative pieces, I now think that these would be pretty nice to use in DnD setups when creating a dungeon layout.</p>
<h1>Reflective Questions</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Tinkering is widely associated with trial-and-error and brainstorming.  Find dictionary definitions of the three techniques, and compare them. Does the definition of tinkering match the definition we have in the course? Also, ask a generative AI tool for the definitions and differences. Which aspects does the answer provided miss?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tinkering: precent participle of tinker, &quot;to make small changes to something, especially in an attempt to repair or improve it.&quot; (<a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/tinkering" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cambridge Dictionairy</a>)</p>
<p>Trial and error: &quot;a way of achieving an aim or solving a problem by trying a number of different methods and learning from the mistakes that you make.&quot;(<a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/trial-and-error?q=Trial-and-error" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cambridge Dictionairy</a>)</p>
<p>Brainstorming: &quot;an activity or business method in which a group of people meet to suggest a lot of new ideas for possible development.&quot; (<a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/brainstorming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cambridge Dictionairy</a>)</p>
<p>From these defenitions, I would argue that the main difference between the three lies in the distance they go. Brainstorming goes the least far, keeping it solely at ideas. While trial and error goes to create something, it has the implication that once the problem is solved, you&#x27;re done. Tinkering is a state of constant improvement. You might have solved the problem that you originally had, but so much more could be done still. However, this definition is not exactly the same as the one given by the course. The defenition given by the course is quite explicit in the physical nature of tinkering, but the Cambridge dictionairy defenition doesn&#x27;t even imply a physical element. The &quot;something&quot; might also be something completely digital, a drawing, or text.</p>
<p>I will not be using generative AI unless you provide me with a fully ethically trained AI, proffesionals have standards!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you take a typical I-Tech related project case, list and explain 5 technical hurdles? To which extent do they allow for a &#x27;playful&#x27; approach in tackling them? Please give arguments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#x27;ll take a project I&#x27;m working on myself for this. The goal is to create wings that can be worn like a backpack and can be moved individually. The first hurdle i had to tacke was the general kinematics of the wings. I didn&#x27;t want the wings to only rotate around the shoulders, nor include an actuator at every joint. Idealy I would have only two actuators, one for each wing. So I went to my trusty box of legos and built a combination of links and kept moving around the joins ever so slightly untill the wing made the movements I wanted it to make.</p>
<p>Next came the part of actually moving the wings. For this there are a few issues. First off, with the way I had designed the wings, I needed vertical linear motion to make the wings move. I needed a material to make the wings out off that wouldn&#x27;t be too heavy. I needed something powerfull enough to move the wings. And I needed to connect everything structurally. Finally, it also had to stay reasonably affordable.</p>
<p>The main idea for the movement was to use a lead screw that I had left over from our M8 project. I&#x27;d cut the 90 CM of screw into two 40CM long sections and connect each to a wing. However, when I connected the whole screw with the motor that I wanted to use, it moved much too fast. This made me realize that I probably needed a gearbox. These were very expensive however. At this point, I could have gone back to the drawing board (I should have) but I got a little too stuck on the whole direct gearbox idea. Had I gone back to the legos to figure out a way to create this actuation I would&#x27;ve realised that I could have just used a worm gear to both reduce the speed as well as create a built in &quot;locking&quot; mechanism. Instead, the project laid abandoned untill I was talking to Edwin one day and he reccomended me this solution. Then, trying to implement this, I once again had an issue, this time with how to best support the lead screw. Where I once again got stuck in the solution I had envisioned. I do think that the biggest mistake I made with all of this is that after having figured out the kinematics I made everything in CAD. Had I stuck to more phisical experimentation I would have found my current solution, which is also a lot simpler, a lot faster. The current plan is to simply use ropes and a locking mechanism like those that can be found in &#x27;JaloezieÃ«n&#x27; to pull the wings up, instead of pushing them using a motor. For the other two points (structural connections and materials) there is no real way of knowing it will work untill I try it. I&#x27;ll want to go for the lightest setup that still structurally works, which will most likely require a few itterations at least. Especially on how to lock the joints in the wing itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where would you go hunting for tinkerspiration? List 5 physical and 5 online resources valuable for an I-Tech specialist. In which did you already find inspiration for a project you did or that got on your bucket list?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the physical inspiration, I mainly use my collections of legos and electronics. However, these are much more focused on making mechanical stuff. For desiging the appearance of things I see quite a value in randomly shaped objects. They might not give a proper guide for how to define the shape of your creation, but they provide a good starting point. A rechtangular box for example could be used to lay out buttons for a machine. A maker space is a very good place for inspiration, not only because you have the tools to immediately get started, but also the general atmosphere there allows you to not reject ideas before you even tried them as quickly, at least im my experiance. Finaly, and this is somehting that works for basically everything, is a place that specifically has nothing to do with what you&#x27;re working on. This kinda ties back into what I was talking about in the last question, but if you&#x27;re always working in the same space, you could get stuck on a single idea that might not even work. Changing your surroundings for a bit might just allow your mind to wander enough to come up with new approaches.</p>
<p>As for digital inspiration, I get most from the youtube channel of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Nerdforge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NerdForge</a>. They make a lot of cool things, most of which are more visually focused rather then mechanical. Further more, art and games have both also acted as inspiration for things I worked on. Games are an especially good point of inspiration when designing Spaceships, which I do for worldbuilding. When it comes to the more mechanical stuff, a good place to start are either tutorials on how the components you have or general discussion forms about the thing you want to use/make. These are very good sources of information And knowing what is possible is about half the equation of figuring out what you will do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>List 5 domains, challenges or settings in which you would like to apply tinkering, and explain why. Can you identify some sweet spots, (perhaps beyond the well-known such as STEM education) and can you also define some limitations? Are there &#x27;untinkerable&#x27; domains?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first thing that comes to mind when applying tinkering to something outside STEM is shot composition in photography. You&#x27;re very deliberately placing objects and/or people and/or locations in your image in such a way that you create the nicest image possible. You could defenetly move quite a few things within this. Not only the objects, but also the place of people and the camera are very dinamic and can easily be changed. The only things that are hard to move would be landscapes and buildings. In a similar way, you can play with the appearance of any visual design. Though they might have their own limitations. Cooking would also defenetly be something where I can see tinkering eventually being beneficial. Right now my cooking is mostly limited to just recipies, but once you get a better understanding of what makes stuff taste good, you would not be as reliant on recipies and could also cook something nice if you only had some leftover ingredients in house. I&#x27;m a little hard pressed on which fields I would want to start using tinkering, but I do already use it (in my opinion) quite a bit when desigining electrical and mechanical systems for projects. I would like to keep doing so.</p>
