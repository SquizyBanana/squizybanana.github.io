<p>In <em>Social Robots from a human perspective</em> an overview of the state of the art in Social Robotics is given, organized in topics of human perception and expectation (Part I), Interaction (Part II) and application domains (Part III). Read (a.o.) chapter 8. Which pointers does this chapter give in/to a design research approach?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Make sure your design is intuative so non-experianced users can also use your product with relative ease. This can for example be done by employing design heuristics, applying metaphores to the design or simplifying the interface.</p>
<p>They also mention communication through the face and facial expressions to be of importance. Especially the first axiom of Watzlawick they highlight which states &quot;one cannot not communicate&quot;, or in more simpler terms, you are always communicating. For this reason for example, last quartile I followed the course teleprecense robotics, where we were researching the effectiveness of conveying emotions through the body language of the robot. We deliberately chose to leave the &quot;face&quot; of the robot empty (white piece of cardboard) as giving it a face, even if it was just two dots as eyes, whould already imply an emotion. What we didn&#x27;t find for the literature review back then but is stated in this book is that facial prominence is also very important. The more the face of a person is in focus the better they are viewed. Thus it stands to reason that focusing on mimicing or antropomorphizing facial expresions will be much more effective in communication then body language. While this was also the eventual result of our research, we had quite a few issues with the emotion recognition software on the operators side so we could not conclude things with certainty.</p>
<p>The final part of this section is about the uncany valley. The book talks a lot about human like robots or artefacts, but given that the book was originally written 10 years ago at this point, and its sources being much older still, this defenition of &quot;human like&quot; will have changed a lot. There are currently a lot of robots that are much more human like then there were 10 years ago. Still the uncany valley is a thing. However now it is more in the movement of the robots rather then their physical appearance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Read chapter 9 as well. What general statements can be made regarding embodiment vs digital content. Apparently users are very capable of maintaining (and living and being assisted by) a boxy thing with a screen. Do we need actuators? Which part of embodiment turns a smartphone into a social robot?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book seems to base its description of a social robot very much around a machines capability to emotionally connect with people. And it makes a good point that on our daily lives, even more now then when this book was written, we are in an almost symbiotic relationship with our phones. The phone, according to the book, embodies a large part of our self expression. Both the personal self expression &quot;I&quot; and the public self expresion &quot;me&quot; are influcened by and communicated through mobile devices. However, I cannot consider a mobile phone (or smart phone, tablet, laptop, etc.) a social robot. For me, the need for actuation is core to the defenition of a robot. Is the mobile phone a social device or a social machine? yes. Is it a social robot? no. Personally I define robots to be machines/devices that employ actuation to facilitate a certain goal or interaction either remotely or autonimously.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now restate your answer on the previous question after watching the movie &#x27;her&#x27;. (the trailer is already a good hint if you didn&#x27;t know the movie) Does this change your perspective?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the few trailers, promotional material and reviews I&#x27;ve seen of the movie, Samantha seems to be either a General or Gernerative AI wo &quot;lives&quot; in or communicates through Theodores phone. To me this is basically the same as the last question, there is no actuation therefore it is not a robot. Is Samantha a social AI? yes, but an AI does not make a robot.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you now compare the work (vincent2015) with the overview by Bar-Cohen et.al.(with a more gripping title) <em>The coming robot revolution</em> which differences in focus can you point out? This work is a decade old. Where did the real world deviate from the predicted revolution?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately our data is already compromised, but this was not done by robots. Rather our personal devices provide nice access for all those intereseted in our data. Often times with out ignorant concent in the form of social media apps. Furthermore, with the current development of AI it also seems that our law makers are much slower then Bar-Cohen et al. expected. AI also shows that companies will not care for ethics if it earns them more money by ignoring them. Bar-Cohen et al. also talk about creating &quot;friendly AI&quot;, which more recently has been refered to as &quot;alignment&quot;. I think the 2nd term for this is much more accurate because unless we figure out a way to create truely sentient AI, all friendlyness will be artificial. A properly aligned robot in this case means a robot who&#x27;s operations align with the desires of all humans around it.</p>
<p>Comparing this to the work of Vincent, it is clear that both have different expectations of how robotics will develop. Vincent is much more positive about the development of social robotics, while Bar-cohen et al. are much more pessimistic. Furthermore, Bar-Cohen seems to be much more focused on a &quot;traditional&quot; definition of a robot while Vincent is trying to find other ways of classifying social robots. Bar-Cohen focuses on how a robot would integrate into human society while Vincent is more interested in how a social device assimilates and undergoes symbiosis with its main user.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Read about the robot hotel and compare their practice against for example the heavily automated CitizenM hotel. Where did the robot hotel went wrong?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems like most of the robots brought in for the Henn-na hotel were more designed as a novelty attraction rather then robots designed for a function first, given that most of its robots were not able to perform the tasks expected of them or even made the stay of guests worse. In comparison, a lot of CitizenM&#x27;s interaction seems to happen though an app that will not react if not opened and designed in a practical and usable manner. However I couldn&#x27;t find too much about it as when writing this the brand was just aquired by Marriot and news about it is filling all my searches.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the story of the Nabaztag rabbit. The &#x27;internet made social&#x27; in 2009. A physical embodiment as user interface for the internet of things. How does this fit definitions of social robot technology? Where does it deviate? No, why was it not successful?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Nabaztag only barely fits within my definition of a robot as it can only actuate its ears. It is best considered to be a mostly digital asistant that has a physical shell that it can use to convey extra information. Its features are limited but that is to be expected for a robot created in 2006. Whether or not the Nabaztag is a social robot depends on whether or not we define communication using social cues to be a one way or two way street. The Nabaztag is able to use lights, ear positions and audio to create certain social cues, but it in no way can measure or react to the social cues of humans around it.</p>
<p>The initial failure of the Nabaztag, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabaztag#cite_note-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its wikipedia page</a>, was due to &quot;a long period of technical difficulties that ultimately led to Violet&#x27;s bankruptcy&quot;. After this the company was bought by Mindscape but they stopped maintanance in 2011. While the wikipedia page does not give a reason for this, it was most likely due to the rise of smartphones as they could do the same as Nabaztag and more in a more convenient package.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Check out the work on cuddlebits. What are key insights in the role and application of design research in this project?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The interpretation of the emotions of the robot often depends on what the person envisioned the robot as. The robots manage to express both arousal (activation) and valence (pleasantness), but valence was harder to recognize for the participants. The process itself relied heavily on rapid prototyping techinques using low costs materials and sketching. They decided to skip the 3D phase of the process and found a way to make the robot just from 2D sketches for even faster prototyping.</p>
<p>(As a feedback note, having to read a paper/chapter per question really isn&#x27;t doable in 10 minutes...)</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/docs/Social Robot Design/GroupWork"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Group Work</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/docs/Social Robot Design/Reflective Questions/Session2"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Session 2</div></a></nav></div></div></div></div></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Docs</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/AboutMe">Portfolio</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">My works</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CoblaTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Youtube<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://trackmania.exchange/usershow/137071" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Trackmania Exchange<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Socials</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://discord.gg/89HXEWar8M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Discord</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="mailto:srozendom@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Email<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2025 Suzanne Rozendom.
