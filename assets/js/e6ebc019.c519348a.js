This is because LEGO intends for serious play to be an introspective and reflective tool. They are very specific on that the questions should be about the models and not the person making the model. Next to that, the main facilitations provided are timekeeping and goal setting. However, LEGO stress that it is important that these goals are open ended. Furthermore, a code of conduct and etiquette are provided. Especially the etiquette feels like it is there for the adults to make sure that they take the process seriously and don\'t simply see it as "playing with toys".'}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(t.blockquote,{children:["\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Read Invent to Learn chapter 5.

His 8 big ideas focus a lot on giving students themselves agency in their learning by allowing them to figure out how to use the materials themselves. The teachers job is not to lecture to them, but rather to guide them in their exploration process. Only one principle of Montesorri's is mentioned in chapter 5: \"Never help a child with a task at which he feels he can succeed.\" This is very in line with Papert's principles of allowing the child to expore and have the teachers act more as guidance. In both, it is not the teachers job to explain a child how to do something, but rather to help them on the things they are stuck on. In this, Montesorri is much more firm then Papert that a teacher should not intervere when the child can figure out the problem on their own. Papert simply mentiones that challenge is good for children as otherwise they might not be as interested in the topic at hand. In similar way this still applies to teens and even adults too. Solving a puzzle is much more satisfying if you did it without any hits. And the further one goes in their education, the more theoretical and thus less hands on the lessons get. This may just be a cause as to why a lot of classes later in life feel a lot more boring then those you followed as a child."}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(t.blockquote,{children:["\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"read Invent To Learn chapter 9.

Next to that, the safety of everyone is obviously very important, but this must not come at the cost of or become the curriculum. While students are working in the space, there must not be the current expectation seen in "normal" classrooms that they must sit down and do what they are told. Rather they must have the space to make discoveries themselves, be allowed to be messy, encouraged to collaborate and document their work. For all of this, a dedicated makerspace is not strictly nescesairy, but there should be a distinct "entering" of the space to make sure that the students don\'t get stuck in the expectations of a "normal" classroom. This can be as simple as changing the layout of the tables or turning around a few banners.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(t.blockquote,{children:["\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Now get back to your own practice as a designer/engineer: where in a process do you use tinkering?"}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Generally tinkering for me has been focused on the first phase(s) of a project.

Next to that, you might also want to collect a bunch of materials, even if they don't directly relate to your problem as you understand it in that moment.

To me the most important one has always been options. When I use the same tools and materials over and over, I tend to get stuck trying to make a certain solution to the problem work, even if its a bad idea. However, when I get told I could use another material or component instead, even if that means I'm less far into the design process, this does generally lead to me actually finding a complete way through. As a kid for example we had (and still have) quite a bit of lego technic. And I loved making things move. Arms, trains, cars. You name it, I've probably tried to make it. But I could never figure out how to drive a car with a single motor, untill a set I got used a differential gear. Not only did this new part make me realize that I could have also just used two other gears at a 90 degree angle, but also that if I wanted to make cars, it was a lot easier to use lego technic then the normal system."}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(t.blockquote,{children:["\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"how do you get in the flow?"}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'I wish there was a flow to my tinkering process.
