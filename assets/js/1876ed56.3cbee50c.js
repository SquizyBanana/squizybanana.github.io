To do so, we came up with a robot that could perform some simple measurements in the waiting room to already collect some general information so the doctors themselves don\u2019t have to do that again. We determined that the system must be able to take Blood pressure, oxidisation, heart rate and temperature measurements, as well as have a language model to ask questions and determine how much pain the patient is in. Furthermore, it should be able to determine priority levels for who gets treated when, be able to detect skin conditions and/or create comparisons to reference images, ask the patients about their level of fatigue, have an approachable appearance and be able to move to patients in case the patients movement is limited. This movement is limited to inside the waiting room, thus the robot can remain tethered.
