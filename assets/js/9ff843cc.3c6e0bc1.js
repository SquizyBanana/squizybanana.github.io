So either staff or one of the elders would ask Rose to get it, and the robot would go fetch it for them. Rose has some antropomorphisation, but its no where near the point where it can be described as humanoid. Thus, a good motion design is required to still replicate the trust and emotional connection that people would have with real humans in the scenario. The design of rose, with exception of its arm, is rather simple. But its arm is core to the scenario, so that lesson wasn't really applied to the robot. It does look like that during the design of Rose, or more specifically PAL Tiago, the places the arm could reach were their main priority, instead of making it look like something more familiar. However the addition of the head then slightly undoes this effect again, as in its current design it mostly resembles a coffee machine with a head, arm and screen. So it sits slightly between antropomorphised and non-natural. Which in turn would probably mean that it takes a bit longer for the residents of the carehome to come to accept the robot as a part of their life."}),"\n",(0,i.jsxs)(o.blockquote,{children:["\n",(0,i.jsx)(o.p,{children:"An often used tool for analysis of motion is the Laban Framework. can you give some good sources where it is applied to HRI, but (more importantly) can you also find one or two alternatives?

There is a lot on how to classify the movements of humans. Not only in the way they position themselves and their limbs, but also how their posture and breathing should be classified. This is used by Sato et al. [2] to define their requirements for so called 'human symbiosis robotics'. Otero et al claim that the understanding of human body motions helps robots plan future goals [3]. The main alternative method that comes in the human motion recognition part of HMI are semantic labels such as in [4]. These are labels defined by the reseracher for motion recognition software to sort its detected motion patterns into. The main advantage of this method is that the reseracher/designer gets to define what motions to keep track of themselves and can optemize their system for a certain interaction. The downside however is that this also means that the designer will miss more subtle motions that might indicate important things for their system as it doesn't provide any real framework. These seem so common that I am unable to find any proper framework for analysis of human motion, only some that use motion to classify different things [5]"}),"\n",(0,i.jsxs)(o.p,{children:["[1] R Konie, A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF LABAN MOVEMENT ANALYSIS,  ",(0,i.jsx)(o.a,{href:"http://www.movementhasmeaning.com",children:"www.movementhasmeaning.com"}),", 2011, Available: ",(0,i.jsx)(o.a,{href:"https://psychomotorischetherapie.info/website/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/LMA-Workshop-Sheet-Laban.pdf",children:"https://psychomotorischetherapie.info/website/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/LMA-Workshop-Sheet-Laban.pdf"}),", last accessed 4-7-2025"]}),"\n",(0,i.jsxs)(o.p,{children:['[2] T.

While the parsing of behaviours is also influenced by this, from my experiance it is done less so then the more subtle body language and speach connotations. As for how I would design the movement to acchieve intentionality I would mainly look at how animators deal with bringing non-living objects to life. They tend to focus a lot more on the "impact" or "energy" with which a movement is performed then exactly how its done. Emotions like happiness could for example be expressed through more bouncy movement while anger is more sharp and fast movements and sadness are slow languishing movements. If the robot has something that looks like eyes, having them constantly look at the object it is manipulating can indicate a focus on the task. And through gestures like pointing, nodding or shaking communication can be established even without language processing. While these take inspiration from human/animal like expressiveness, they don\'t 1:1 coppy them. Rather they try to get to the core of why the expressions work and then see if they can apply that on whatever object they are animating.'}),"\n",(0,i.jsxs)(o.blockquote,{children:["\n",(0,i.jsx)(o.p,{children:"So far we have focussed mainly on motion as a means for expression.
