Especially the first axiom of Watzlawick they highlight which states "one cannot not communicate", or in more simpler terms, you are always communicating. For this reason for example, last quartile I followed the course teleprecense robotics, where we were researching the effectiveness of conveying emotions through the body language of the robot. We deliberately chose to leave the "face" of the robot empty (white piece of cardboard) as giving it a face, even if it was just two dots as eyes, whould already imply an emotion. What we didn\'t find for the literature review back then but is stated in this book is that facial prominence is also very important. The more the face of a person is in focus the better they are viewed. Thus it stands to reason that focusing on mimicing or antropomorphizing facial expresions will be much more effective in communication then body language. While this was also the eventual result of our research, we had quite a few issues with the emotion recognition software on the operators side so we could not conclude things with certainty.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'The final part of this section is about the uncany valley.

There are currently a lot of robots that are much more human like then there were 10 years ago. Still the uncany valley is a thing.

And it makes a good point that on our daily lives, even more now then when this book was written, we are in an almost symbiotic relationship with our phones. The phone, according to the book, embodies a large part of our self expression. Both the personal self expression "I" and the public self expresion "me" are influcened by and communicated through mobile devices. However, I cannot consider a mobile phone (or smart phone, tablet, laptop, etc.) a social robot. For me, the need for actuation is core to the defenition of a robot. Is the mobile phone a social device or a social machine? yes. Is it a social robot? no.

AI also shows that companies will not care for ethics if it earns them more money by ignoring them. Bar-Cohen et al. also talk about creating "friendly AI", which more recently has been refered to as "alignment". I think the 2nd term for this is much more accurate because unless we figure out a way to create truely sentient AI, all friendlyness will be artificial.
