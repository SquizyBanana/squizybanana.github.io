The idea behind the connector is that a square piece nicely fits through the hole when rotated at 45 degrees, but when its rotated back its locked in place because the corners hook behind the back side of the hole. Later on I also made blocks with a slit instead of a hole and a round connector to allow for joints. This then also expanded into a block acting as a joint. Furthermore I throught up some support bars that can be "screwed" onto the side of the blocks, but I didn\'t really like their appearance. But this did get me thinking about what would happen if you were to try and create a bigger block out of these blocks. It made me realize that with the base setup you couldn\'t combine 4 in a 2x2 setup because you couldn\'t rotate the blocks anymore. The solution i came up with is a slit in the connectors and holes through the bloks so the connectors can be "screwed" in after combining the blocks. I also came up with some more compex shapes, as well as some decorative pieces. With their shape and especially the decorative pieces, I now think that these would be pretty nice to use in DnD setups when creating a dungeon layout.']}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.h1,{id:"making-it-real",children:"Making it real"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"After having the design made, I recreated it in Fusion360.
