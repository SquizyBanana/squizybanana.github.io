(The current conditions are already bordeline too messy even though half the mess isn't mine). The dissadvantages of having to live with your parents I guess...

I'm not very tempted to go out of my general space at my desk to go tinker on stuff. One could argue that making maps in Trackmania could qualify as tinkering, because while you're trying a lot of things, you do them based on your knowledge of the car and the games physics, as well as why the last thing you tried didn't work. However, the most \"hands on\" this gets is testing the map, where you're still just pressing buttons. The main time I am motivated enough to actually get off my lazy ass and go make stuff is generally when I'm making something for someone else. But this only happens maybe once every three months. So for me probably the first thing I would want to expand my tinkering space is a way for all three spaces, or at least everything in my room and at my desk, to be integrated together. That way I will be much more tempted to actually start tinkering with stuff again."})]})}function c(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,a.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,n.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,n.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},2782:(e,t,s)=>{s.d(t,{A:()=>o});const o=s.p+"assets/images/Desk-d1f0d2d945e61ae0e2bf1e595fb9d560.jpg"},8436:(e,t,s)=>{s.d(t,{A:()=>o});const o=s.p+"assets/images/Room-68409f9528c0d028e9f3f2b520ac8f29.jpg"},8453:(e,t,s)=>{s.d(t,{R:()=>i,x:()=>r});var o=s(6540);const n={},a=o.createContext(n);function i(e){const t=o.useContext(a);return o.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function r(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(n):e.components||n:i(e.components),o.createElement(a.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
