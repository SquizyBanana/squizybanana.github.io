To me embodyment and virtualisation can be seen as two sliders that are not mutually exclusive. While at some point increasing embodiment reduces virtualness and vice versa, many combinations can still exist. Something like a humanoid body with a screen as a face is a good example of a hybrid shape. Or a virtual agent that can also 'pupeteer' a robot arm. It mainly comes down to how the AI part of the robot is presented. Is the AI part of the robot body or is it on the computer and does it drive the body around? Examples of both are very common throughout fiction writing especially where robots can be given much more character. Wall-E and Eve for example are very much embodied robots, where as PAL from 'mitchels vs. the machines' is an AI that is usually a virtual agent housed in phones, but can take over controll of the robots of the world and thus temporarily \"gaining\" embodyment while still at her core being a virtual agent."}),"\n",(0,i.jsxs)(t.blockquote,{children:["\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Can you find insights or work on dealing in a structured way with the robotic capabilities and social aspects of the design?

Where functional requirements will focus a lot more on the robotic capablilities of the robot, the non-functional requirements are where the social aspects of the design can be better covered. This framework allows for the rigid definition of (safety) requirements of the robot as well as the more fluid and dynamic requirements of the social side of the robot.

Given that they boast that pepper has \"expressive movements\" it was clear that the robot was intended to be able to display emotions. However, since they had decided that the camera's needed to be in the eyes of pepper, they can't do much with facial expressions anymore. There are also robots like Moxie [3], who seem to have been designed with the social requirements as their main functions. This leads to a very good match between the 'function defines form' and social design parts of the design, as they have been one since the start of the process.

Even if it is only though weak AI like Duffy supports. Giving the robot a sophisticated enough AI to be able to trick the people around it into thinking that the robot has thoughts too can help with giving the robot more agency and thus makes it easier to form an emotional connection with the robot. It also means that (as long as the percieved intelligence isn\'t too high) people around the robot might be more tollerant of it when it makes a mistake, and might generally treat it better then if it was simply a "stupid brick". This also means that for our exact scenario people may be more prone to get out of the way of the robot or let it through if they are blocking the hallway with their conversation.'}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Another thing that is basically required for our scenario is artifical sociability, as the request to fetch something will most likely be done through speech. And given the quality of current speech-to-text technology, there might be moments where Rose could misunderstand so it needs to ask for clarification. This functionality could also be used outside of the exact scenario when interacting with people in general. This can again lead to an easier establisment of emotional connection and the benefits that come with that."}),"\n",(0,i.jsxs)(t.p,{children:['[4] B.R.
