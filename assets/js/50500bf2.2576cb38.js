The idea behind the connector is that a square piece nicely fits through the hole when rotated at 45 degrees, but when its rotated back its locked in place because the corners hook behind the back side of the hole. Later on I also made blocks with a slit instead of a hole and a round connector to allow for joints. This then also expanded into a block acting as a joint. Furthermore I throught up some support bars that can be "screwed" onto the side of the blocks, but I didn\'t really like their appearance. But this did get me thinking about what would happen if you were to try and create a bigger block out of these blocks. It made me realize that with the base setup you couldn\'t combine 4 in a 2x2 setup because you couldn\'t rotate the blocks anymore. The solution i came up with is a slit in the connectors and holes through the bloks so the connectors can be "screwed" in after combining the blocks. I also came up with some more compex shapes, as well as some decorative pieces.

The goal is to create wings that can be worn like a backpack and can be moved individually. The first hurdle i had to tacke was the general kinematics of the wings. I didn't want the wings to only rotate around the shoulders, nor include an actuator at every joint. Idealy I would have only two actuators, one for each wing. So I went to my trusty box of legos and built a combination of links and kept moving around the joins ever so slightly untill the wing made the movements I wanted it to make."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Next came the part of actually moving the wings. For this there are a few issues. First off, with the way I had designed the wings, I needed vertical linear motion to make the wings move. I needed a material to make the wings out off that wouldn't be too heavy. I needed something powerfull enough to move the wings. And I needed to connect everything structurally. Finally, it also had to stay reasonably affordable."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The main idea for the movement was to use a lead screw that I had left over from our M8 project. I'd cut the 90 CM of screw into two 40CM long sections and connect each to a wing. However, when I connected the whole screw with the motor that I wanted to use, it moved much too fast. This made me realize that I probably needed a gearbox. These were very expensive however. At this point, I could have gone back to the drawing board (I should have) but I got a little too stuck on the whole direct gearbox idea. Had I gone back to the legos to figure out a way to create this actuation I would've realised that I could have just used a worm gear to both reduce the speed as well as create a built in \"locking\" mechanism. Instead, the project laid abandoned untill I was talking to Edwin one day and he reccomended me this solution. Then, trying to implement this, I once again had an issue, this time with how to best support the lead screw. Where I once again got stuck in the solution I had envisioned. I do think that the biggest mistake I made with all of this is that after having figured out the kinematics I made everything in CAD. Had I stuck to more phisical experimentation I would have found my current solution, which is also a lot simpler, a lot faster. The current plan is to simply use ropes and a locking mechanism like those that can be found in 'Jaloezie\xebn' to pull the wings up, instead of pushing them using a motor. For the other two points (structural connections and materials) there is no real way of knowing it will work untill I try it. I'll want to go for the lightest setup that still structurally works, which will most likely require a few itterations at least.
