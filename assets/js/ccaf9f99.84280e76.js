In contrast, most "normal" sci-fi stories leave out or even completely skip the background research in their work. Nor do they have an explicit reflection. In these stories the reflection is usually implicit and left up to the reader. The difference between SFP and generic scenario-based design is the focus of the speculation. For scenario based design, this focus is often on the now and what would be possible with current(ly developing) technology, where as SFP is more focused on what the results would be when scientific developments are further along or new developments are made. Furthermore, SFP allows for an easier exploration of a culture wide response to a situation then normal scenario-based design.
