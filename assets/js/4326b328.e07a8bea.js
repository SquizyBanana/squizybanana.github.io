If its less precious participants are more likely to make a lot of quick itterations, possibly only fulfilling one criteria, and then combine them. If the materials are more preciouss, the participants are more likely to try and make one thing that fulfills all criterias from the start. I would generally say that the first is more preferable, as it becomes easier to test the influence of the individual criterias and it also gives a better idea of what criterias the participants consider most important. Once material has been selected, the appropriate tools for it should be provided. Here, a balance must be struck between allowing the participants to do what they want with the material without overwhelming them with the options.

This could lead to quicker tinkering with new designs, lighter designs and most importantly, novel designs that would not work as well with more conventional robotics. The two major downsides to origami as compared to more traditional robotics however are the fact that paper and cardboard are less structurally sound then say plastic or aluminium, and through experimentation we found out that a lot of action origami is based on the spring like effect of paper folds, but this effect weakens over time. Thus, origami robots would most likely not last as long as standard robots."}),"\n",(0,o.jsxs)(t.blockquote,{children:["\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"what is the impact your session have regarding (more) stuff, ecological footprint and impact on our planet (i.e. how can you avoid that STEM workshops with waste material result in more waste material?)"}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Given the fact that these robots are not likely to last very long, there would be more waste. Furthermore, the development of origami robots generally also requires more itterations as it is somewhat hard to wrap your head around the mechanics of how it all works. However, the large majority of this will be paper waste, which can be recycled. The mechanical parts will most likely wear at the same rate as in normal robotics. But this time, less metals are needed to make the robots work. So as long as not too many extra trees have to be cut down to make all the paper, I think it would have a marginally positive influence on the climate. Paper is also a lot cheaper then more conventional materials, which allows more people to get a start with robotics then before."})]})}function d(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,o.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,o.jsx)(c,{...e})}):c(e)}},8453:(e,t,i)=>{i.d(t,{R:()=>a,x:()=>r});var n=i(6540);const o={},s=n.createContext(o);function a(e){const t=n.useContext(s);return n.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function r(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(o):e.components||o:a(e.components),n.createElement(s.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
