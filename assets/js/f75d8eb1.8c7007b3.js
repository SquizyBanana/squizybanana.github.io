The materials paper, cardboard and servos. And the scaffholding would be instructions on basic shapes. The workshop would probably be given in the context of the soft robotics course, and last an afternoon. The idea for the session was that students would use the materials and instructions to make a moving robot in groups, which are then shown off at the end of the day."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"For the Foley art, the intended seed was the sounds different objects could make. The materials were a random collection of household items like pans, pots, cups, cutlery, shoes, etc. The scaffholding for this would be a short explanation or video of a foley artist at work. After which the students would be given a clip with no audio (preferably one where the apropriate sounds aren't obvious) for which they would have to create an audio track."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'For the 3D "printing", the intended seed was the individual layers of a print. The materials were packaging foam of about 5mm thickness to replicate the general structure of prints at a larger scale, and some glue that wouldn\'t stick overly well but just enough to keep them in place. The scafholding for this is a litle more present then the other workshop ideas as there are some rules. The most important of which is to only place the foam in layers and to not start glueing foam cutouts to the side of things. The goal of this workshop was to teach CreaTe students some concepts about 3D printing, as we were never taught those when folowing the bachelor. Instead we had to find out through trial and error.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"During the presentations, a few issues with the later two were pointed out to us. Mainly that neither allowed for an unexpected outcome. Furthermore, we also realized that to teach the 3D workshop properly, there should be some goal that incorporates both bridging and torque, further limiting creativity. Because of these factors, we decided to continue with the origami idea."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"After the presentations, we did a bit of research into self-folding robots. However their designs were generally created using algorithms instead of direct designs. And they mostly folded themselves using shape memory alloys/polymers or heat activated materials. All of which are much too precious for a tinkering workshop. Instead, we decided to focus on robots that actuate around folds in paper, using different actuators. Mainly Air channels in the form of balloons and electric servo motors. While Piezoelectric materials are also an option, they are more precious and harder to get started with, and thus a less suitable option for a tinkering workshop."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"We also worked out the idea further, filling in the template provided by the course. We set the intended goal for the students to be significantly moving a ball using origami techniques. With possible learing goals being about origami and the movement possibilities that come from it. As tools we intend to provide an external power and controll unit, as having to design a robot that can also carry those is a whole different challenge. Next to that we also provide more general tools like scissors, glue, pencils, rules and tape. With the original planning, the session would last 3.5 hours and be held in groups of 3-4 students."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"After filling out the template, we decided to try and figure out ourselves how to fold robots like this, starting with some simple shapes.
