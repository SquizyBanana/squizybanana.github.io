The materials were a random collection of household items like pans, pots, cups, cutlery, shoes, etc. The scaffholding for this would be a short explanation or video of a foley artist at work.

The materials were packaging foam of about 5mm thickness to replicate the general structure of prints at a larger scale, and some glue that wouldn\'t stick overly well but just enough to keep them in place. The scafholding for this is a litle more present then the other workshop ideas as there are some rules. The most important of which is to only place the foam in layers and to not start glueing foam cutouts to the side of things. The goal of this workshop was to teach CreaTe students some concepts about 3D printing, as we were never taught those when folowing the bachelor. Instead we had to find out through trial and error.'}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"During the presentations, a few issues with the later two were pointed out to us. Mainly that neither allowed for an unexpected outcome. Furthermore, we also realized that to teach the 3D workshop properly, there should be some goal that incorporates both bridging and torque, further limiting creativity. Because of these factors, we decided to continue with the origami idea."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"After the presentations, we did a bit of research into self-folding robots. However their designs were generally created using algorithms instead of direct designs. And they mostly folded themselves using shape memory alloys/polymers or heat activated materials. All of which are much too precious for a tinkering workshop. Instead, we decided to focus on robots that actuate around folds in paper, using different actuators. Mainly Air channels in the form of balloons and electric servo motors. While Piezoelectric materials are also an option, they are more precious and harder to get started with, and thus a less suitable option for a tinkering workshop."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"We also worked out the idea further, filling in the template provided by the course. We set the intended goal for the students to be significantly moving a ball using origami techniques. With possible learing goals being about origami and the movement possibilities that come from it. As tools we intend to provide an external power and controll unit, as having to design a robot that can also carry those is a whole different challenge. Next to that we also provide more general tools like scissors, glue, pencils, rules and tape. To get students familiar with origami we will go through a few examples with them at the start of the session too. With the original planning, the session would last 3.5 hours and be held in groups of 3-4 students."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"After filling out the template, we decided to try and figure out ourselves how to fold robots like this, starting with some simple shapes.

Thus we swaped the simple butterfly with this better, all be it slightly more complicated, version for the examples to be shown at the start of the session. Next to that we also use the pecking bird and half of the working design in our final set of examples. The pecking bird is done first as it is a good introduction to origami in general too and shows very basic folding movement. After that the butterfly is done as it involves a few slightly more complex folds and movements. Finally half of our design is made as, while its rather simple, it gives a good example of how to think about the folds and what movements they might create. The spring was left out because we couldn't even make it in the roughly 10 hours we spent as a group trying to get an understanding of action origami."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"During testing, the participants graspt the pecking bird rather quickly. We skipped doing the butterfly and our own example for time sake as for the test we only had 2 hours instead of the intended 3.5. Instead we had all the examples on a slide show that they could scroll through, as well as the three examples prefolded as reference. From this they managed to all individually create the pecking bird before they started to experiment with different folds as well as some others they found online. In the end, their final solution was to create a robot that made origami frogs jump at the ball to move it."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:(0,s.jsx)(t.img,{alt:"The participants during the test",src:o(3629).A+"",width:"3008",height:"1328"})})]})}function c(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,n.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,s.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,s.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},8453:(e,t,o)=>{o.d(t,{R:()=>a,x:()=>r});var i=o(6540);const s={},n=i.createContext(s);function a(e){const t=i.useContext(n);return i.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function r(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(s):e.components||s:a(e.components),i.createElement(n.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
