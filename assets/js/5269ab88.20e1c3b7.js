Of the three, I only saw value in the first as the other two were just already existing things with extra limitations placed upon them. The BYOR was nice as you didn't need any real preknowledge to start using the components, and there was also clearly some thought put into its interfacability with the holes through the PCBs and the provided splitpins. The grove kit was just an arduino starter kit but with different connectors. This meant that these parts could not (easily) be combined with other arduino projects. Furthermore, the parts were all connected in such a way that they already worked in their frame, but the manual (which was hidden behind a QR code) told us to remove them from the frame. Even if we weren't supposed to put the things back into the box the way we found them, this would still be bad becaouse it would feel like breaking the components. The makedo cardboard screws were just splitpins that needed more support and could not turn when used. There is 0 reason I would use these over splitpins. Overall I think that the most important elements of the materials for them to be good tinkering materials were that they were (relatively) easy to use given a persons preknowledge of them, as well as that they should be mouldable to do the things you want them to do, or at least an approximation of them. If this is not directly possible through the material itself then at least it should be able to be interfaced with a material that can make up for what it is lacking."}),"\n",(0,i.jsxs)(t.blockquote,{children:["\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Now also take a moment to consider your own thinking during the session.

With the BYOR this was easy, with the screws this was obvious, with the grove kit it was not very clear. Once I had a bit of a grasp on that I tried to figure out how to use them. Be it through the manual or just experimenting. This worked well for both the BYOR and screws, but not for the sensor kit. The issue with the sensor kit was that it did not have a clear intended use, as there were only really inputs. The only output that seemed to do anything was the little screen that just showed the measured data. The next step happened when I stumbled upon a limitation. To see if there was a way around it. One of the things that weirded me out at first was that the stepper in the BYOR kit could only turn in one way. But after some playing with the part I noticed the reverse switch. Similarly, when working with the screws I figured out that if you make a small cut from the hole of the screw outwards you could have the screw turn in one direction while staying stuck. These attempts at getting around limitations can be rather helpfull, especially in systems that seem rather limiting at first."}),"\n",(0,i.jsxs)(t.blockquote,{children:["\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"which of the experienced tools and materials has the lowest threshold? i.e which materials are easiest to get started with (are grabbed right away, no thinking, no consideration)"}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Of the three the cardboard and screws were the easiest to get started with, but at the same time if you are only using the screws for attachments then it is also the material where you run into limitations the quickest.

Sometimes succesfull as was the case with BYOR, sometimes unsuccesfull as was the case with the grove kit. The seed of the two kits were the electronics, something unknown that was supposed to have some functionality that you wanted to discover. For the BYOR kit, a quick glance at the manual was enough to figure out how to power it, and after that our preknowledge of electronics was enough. For the grove kit, a lot more knowledge was required. This was provided through a digital manual. For this kit more general arduino tutorials would have probably also helped. It is a bit hard to say what we learned exactly throughout the tinkering process, as most of the tools we used we either already knew, or were lower level versions of things we knew. But especially when playing around with the BYOR kit, we eventually managed to chain all components back to back from the turn nob all the way to the stepper."})]})}function c(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,n.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,i.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},8453:(e,t,o)=>{o.d(t,{R:()=>a,x:()=>r});var s=o(6540);const i={},n=s.createContext(i);function a(e){const t=s.useContext(n);return s.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function r(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(i):e.components||i:a(e.components),s.createElement(n.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
